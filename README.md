# Player Selection System
 
The Player Selection System is designed to allow the user to select up to 5 players from a list of available players, view the selected players on another screen, and save or modify their selection. It uses a combination of Unity's Scriptable Objects, MVC architecture, and UI components to create a flexible and modular system.
